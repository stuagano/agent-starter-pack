# Penny Assistant

Penny is a personal digital assistant agent that helps you:
- Read and answer questions about your uploaded PDF documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Create and manage personal lists (to-dos, shopping, etc.)
- Read your calendar events (Google Calendar integration)

This agent is built using the agent-starter-pack and extends the RAG agent template with additional personal assistant features.
