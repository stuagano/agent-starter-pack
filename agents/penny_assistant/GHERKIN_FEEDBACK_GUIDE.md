# Gherkin Feedback Interface Guide 📝

## Overview

The Gherkin Feedback Interface allows you to provide structured, natural language feedback about Penny Assistant using Gherkin syntax. This makes it easy to describe issues, feature requests, and testing scenarios in a clear, standardized format.

## 🎯 What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is a business-readable domain-specific language used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It provides a structured way to describe software behavior in natural language.

### **Basic Gherkin Keywords:**
- `Feature:` - What feature you're testing
- `Scenario:` - Specific scenario being tested
- `Given` - Preconditions or setup
- `When` - Actions taken
- `Then` - Expected outcomes
- `And` - Additional conditions or outcomes
- `But` - Negative conditions or outcomes
- `#` - Comments (optional)

## 📋 How to Use the Feedback Interface

### **1. Access the Feedback Page**
- Navigate to the "Feedback" tab in the sidebar
- You'll see the feedback submission form

### **2. Select Feedback Category**
Choose from:
- **Bug Report** - Something isn't working as expected
- **Feature Request** - New functionality you'd like to see
- **Usability Issue** - Problems with the user interface
- **Performance** - Speed or resource usage issues
- **Documentation** - Issues with help text or guides
- **Other** - Anything else

### **3. Set Priority**
- **Low** - Nice to have, not urgent
- **Medium** - Important but not blocking
- **High** - Important and should be addressed soon
- **Critical** - Blocking issue that needs immediate attention

### **4. Write Your Feedback**
Use the Gherkin syntax to describe your feedback:

```gherkin
Feature: PDF Upload and Processing
Scenario: User uploads a PDF and asks questions
  Given I am on the PDF Upload page
  And I have a valid PDF file
  When I upload the PDF file
  And I wait for processing to complete
  And I ask "What is the main topic?"
  Then I should see a relevant answer
  And the answer should reference the PDF content
  But I should not see placeholder text
```

### **5. Submit Your Feedback**
- Click "Submit Feedback" to save your entry
- Your feedback will be stored and can be reviewed later

## 📝 Feedback Examples

### **Bug Report Example**
```gherkin
Feature: List Management
Scenario: Creating a new list fails
  Given I am on the Lists page
  And I enter a list name "Shopping List"
  When I click "Create List"
  Then I should see "List 'Shopping List' created!"
  But instead I see "Failed to create list: Database error"
  And the list does not appear in my lists
# This happens consistently with any list name
```

### **Feature Request Example**
```gherkin
Feature: Calendar Integration
Scenario: User wants to create calendar events
  Given I am on the Calendar page
  And I can see my existing events
  When I click "Create New Event"
  Then I should see a form to enter event details
  And I should be able to set title, date, time, and location
  And the event should be saved to my Google Calendar
  But currently there is no "Create New Event" button
# This would make the calendar feature much more useful
```

### **Usability Issue Example**
```gherkin
Feature: PDF Upload Interface
Scenario: User uploads wrong file type
  Given I am on the PDF Upload page
  And I try to upload a .docx file
  When I click "Upload and Process"
  Then I should see a clear error message
  And the error should explain that only PDFs are supported
  And I should be able to easily select a different file
  But currently the error message is unclear
# The error just says "Upload failed" without explanation
```

### **Performance Issue Example**
```gherkin
Feature: RAG Query Processing
Scenario: Large PDF takes too long to process
  Given I upload a 50-page PDF document
  When I click "Upload and Process"
  Then processing should complete within 30 seconds
  And I should see a progress indicator
  But currently it takes over 2 minutes
  And there's no indication of progress
# This makes the feature unusable for large documents
```

## 🔍 Reviewing Feedback

### **Feedback History**
- All submitted feedback is stored and can be reviewed
- Use filters to find specific feedback by category, priority, or status
- Each entry shows the parsed Gherkin structure for easy reading

### **Status Management**
You can update the status of feedback entries:
- **New** - Just submitted
- **In Progress** - Being worked on
- **Resolved** - Issue fixed or feature implemented
- **Won't Fix** - Not going to be addressed

### **Export Options**
- **Export as JSON** - Download all feedback data
- **Export Summary** - Download a text summary with statistics

## 💡 Tips for Writing Good Feedback

### **Be Specific**
❌ **Bad:** "The app is slow"
✅ **Good:** "When I upload a 10MB PDF, it takes 45 seconds to process"

### **Include Context**
❌ **Bad:** "It doesn't work"
✅ **Good:** "When I'm on the Lists page and try to create a new list..."

### **Describe Expected vs Actual Behavior**
❌ **Bad:** "The button is broken"
✅ **Good:** "When I click the 'Create List' button, I expect to see a success message, but instead I see an error"

### **Use Comments for Additional Context**
```gherkin
Feature: Chat Interface
Scenario: Chat responses are too slow
  Given I am in the Chat page
  When I ask "What is machine learning?"
  Then I should get a response within 5 seconds
  But currently it takes 15-20 seconds
# This happens consistently, not just occasionally
# I have a fast internet connection, so it's not network related
```
